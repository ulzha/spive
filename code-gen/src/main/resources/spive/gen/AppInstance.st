/**
 * Glue code generated by Spīve, which facilitates strongly typed input and output.
 *
 * <p>Besides event handling, your Foo application may also comprise lightweight background
 * workloads, unpredictable query serving workloads, long running heavy computation workloads, etc.
 * Implement them as inner classes which implement Runnable, and Spīve platform will pick them up;
 * see Workloads doc. (TODO without reflection? more like an explicit registerWorkloads()?)
 *
 * <p>Note that as soon as one run() method exits, the instance is considered "done", the rest of
 * run() methods get interrupted as well, and the instance is stopped.
 *
 * <p>The workload Runnables may get autoscaled independently from each other. A given Foo instance
 * runs at most one instance of each workload. Apart from this guarantee, your code should not make
 * assumptions as to which (if any) workload Runnables coexist on a given instance of Foo.
 *
 * <p>The workload Runnables can freely rely on in-memory state of Foo, but they should never modify
 * this state, nor create side effects through gateways, except for emitting events through {@code
 * output} gateway.

  /**

   * of the stack for application developers. Should strive to eliminate any obscureness of late
